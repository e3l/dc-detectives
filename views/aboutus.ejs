  <h3>
      <center>The DC Detective is an all-in-one platform that aims to compile the stream of new policies and ideas that
      constantly flows from our nationâ€™s capital.</center>
  </h3>
  <h3>
    <center> We give a comprehensive and unbiased look at recent executive orders and bills. These are turbulent times
      where politics is at the heart of our issues around the country.</center>
  </h3>
  <h3>
    <center> Especially in the information era, it is surprising that citizens do not have a place to learn what nation-changing 
      policies the president is enacting. Instead of relying on the media to present only what they deem exciting, it is important 
      for citizens to be able to access easy to understand information easily. </center>
  </h3>
  <h3>
    <center>The DC Detective aims to rectify this problem, giving a straightforward, no malarkey solution by providing
      information directly from lawmakers to you.</center>
